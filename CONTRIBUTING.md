##### Contributing 

- Currently the repo has barely any prototypes for many of the provided functions so adding them would be useful
- Adding support for avx2 
- Replica for testing mutually authenticated key exchange mechanism

All of the above are fairly easy and would only need someone to look at function prototypes and add them so it would be suitable for a new contributor

###### Guidelines
- Create an issue and then raise PR
- Ask questions in the issue if you want help
